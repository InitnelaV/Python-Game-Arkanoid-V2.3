A deeper version of Arkanoid, this one includes 3 levels.
Each level can be selected from the start using keys 1, 2, or 3.

An extra life is awarded every 1,000 points (at the end of a level, each block is worth 20 points, multiplied by 50 blocks...).

Arkanoid was the first script I fully recreated from a tutorial.
It wasn’t the simplest, but surprisingly not the most complex either—it fit into a single file and only required 2 interpreters.
I was quite amazed at the time to have successfully done a simple copy/paste. I customized this copy/paste… then I started getting interested in Python and its simplicity.
Since then, I’ve evolved in Python, design, and thinking (though I still sometimes go overboard).

Have fun, take this code, optimize it, and feel free to keep me updated on its evolution/remix, and share your achievements. Thanks! ;)
